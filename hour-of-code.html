<h2>What happened during the event?</h2>
<p>
    Before this event, our team decided on roles and prepared a presentation. 
    We faced some technical problems during the event. There was an poor internet connectivity. 
    However, after we solved this issue, we faced with another problem,the computer, which was connected to the projector, still coulnd't connect to the internet.
    Finally, we decided to show everything on our own computers.
